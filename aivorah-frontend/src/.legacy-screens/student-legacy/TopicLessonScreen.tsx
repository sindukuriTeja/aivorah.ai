Ten Lakhs = 10,00,000. Crores = 1,00,00,000 — that is ten million! Ten Crores = 10,00,00,000. Interesting fact: One lakh rupees is used every day in conversations in India.

Always compare from the leftmost digit because that place has the highest value. If those digits are equal, move one place right until you find a difference.

Italy was the centre of classical music in the 1600s and 1700s, so Italian terms became the world standard." },

Special markings: crescendo, shown as a growing arrow, means gradually getting louder. Decrescendo or diminuendo, shown as a shrinking arrow, means gradually getting softer.

Beethoven's Fifth Symphony opens with a famous short-short-short-LONG pattern played forte and allegro — loud and fast — creating drama and tension. A lullaby is typically andante or adagio with piano dynamics — slow and soft — creating calm and sleep. A march is allegro and forte — fast and loud — creating energy and power. A hymn is adagio and mezzo-forte — slow and medium loud — creating reverence." },

The quietest dynamic marking in orchestral music is ppp — triple piano — barely a whisper. Conductors use baton speed and height to signal tempo and dynamics to musicians. When a DJ gradually makes music louder and faster on a dance floor, they are using crescendo and accelerando — musical techniques used for centuries!" },

Timbre is the unique quality of a sound that makes one instrument different from another, even when they play the same note at the same volume. It is sometimes called tone colour.

        voice: "Timbre is created by three things: the material the instrument is made from, the shape and size of the instrument, and how sound is produced. A violin has a warm singing tone because the wooden body amplifies string vibrations. A trumpet has a bright brassy sound because air vibrates through a long metal tube with a flared bell. A drum has a resonant boom because hitting a stretched membrane creates complex vibrations. Even the human voice has unique timbre — that is why you recognise your friend's voice on the phone." },

A cello has a warm, rich timbre. An oboe has a reedy, nasal timbre. A tuba has a dark, round timbre. When you say a voice sounds warm, or a guitar sounds bright, you are actually describing timbre! Musicians choose instruments for specific timbres to create the exact mood they want." },

Tenor is the higher male voice — bright and ringing. Baritone is the medium male voice. Bass is the lowest male voice — deep and resonant. Choirs use all these voice types together to create a full, harmonious sound. In Carnatic and Hindustani music, the tone quality of the voice is called swara and is considered extremely important." },

The unique combination of these overtones creates each instrument's timbre. That is why two instruments playing the same note sound different — they have different overtone patterns! Computer music uses this science to digitally recreate instrument sounds. And your voiceprint — the unique pattern of your voice's timbre — is so unique it can be used to identify you, just like a fingerprint." },
